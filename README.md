Machine learning for behavioural data - Project

1. Topic
Studying the consumption of music over time by creating lyrics related features such as topics and emotions.
2. Research Questions
- Can we extract common topics of song lyrics and use them as meaningful features?
- Is it possible to relate it to emotions a song might convey.
- We can include both features in the analysis of the music consumption over time.
- Can we see patterns of emotional state that generalizes over all users.
- Creation of a psychological profile based on the songs users listen to.
3. Proposed dataset
- Last.fm Dataset - 1K users
- Spotify API: To find the mood of a song we can use the spotify API
- Lyrics from different web pages
4. Methods
- Requests or existing data set to associate the lyrics to the different songs.
- Cluster the songs by lyrics for topics or emotions (e.g spectral clustering, topic
modeling implementations)
- Analyse how this clusters are distributed over the time for different groups of user
